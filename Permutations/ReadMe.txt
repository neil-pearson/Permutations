I have I have created the program in C# as a console app and it can be run in Visual Studio.
It takes a filename (of a file with rows matching the example) as the initial parameter and returns the printout to the console window.
I have also added other files for testing and as other examples.
I have added Unit Testing to test the methods I created, and also one Moq test as an example.
